"""Live YOLO computer vision on a SiMa Modalix DevKit 3.0.

    pip install sima-vision
    sima-vision detect

Two commands, and the second one is the work. There is no setup step: a run
finds the Neat runtime, puts the board's numpy and OpenCV on the path,
downloads the model pack and a sample clip, and prints what it is doing at each
stage. See :mod:`sima_vision.bootstrap` and :mod:`sima_vision.console`.

Three applications share one pipeline: object detection, instance segmentation
with an optional background blur, and fall detection with SMTP alerts. They
differ only in what they do with a frame once the MLA has finished with it, so
everything up to that point -- config loading, assets, source geometry, the Neat
graph, sample decoding, drawing and the sinks -- lives in this package and is
written once. A fourth application is one class and one entry point; see
:mod:`sima_vision.tasks`.

From the command line::

    sima-vision detect  --source clip.h264 --model yolo26m-det.tar.gz
    sima-vision segment --source clip.h264 --model yolo26m-seg.tar.gz --blur
    sima-vision fall    --source rtsp://camera/live --alert-to ops@example.com

or from Python, with the same settings under the same names::

    from sima_vision import run, validate

    validate("detect", conf=0.5)                           # no board needed
    run("detect", source="clip.h264", model="yolo26m-det.tar.gz", conf=0.5)

Inference runs **on the DevKit**, not in the x86 SDK container: ``pyneat`` is
compiled for aarch64. Everything that needs it is deferred, so ``--validate``
and ``--help`` work anywhere.
