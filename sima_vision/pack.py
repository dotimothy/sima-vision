"""Finishing a compiled pack so the board's pipeline can read it.

The Model SDK's compile writes three things into the archive: the MLA ELF, the
``*_mpk.json`` manifest describing the compiled graph, and a stats file. What
the board reads before any of that is a *fourth* thing, and a different shape
of thing -- ``pipeline_sequence.json``, which names the two stages a frame goes
through, and the plugin configs those stages point at::

    simaaiprocesspreproc_1   CVU   preproc   0_preproc.json
    simaaiprocessmla_1       MLA   mla       0_process_mla.json

A pack without them gets as far as being opened and then fails::

    preprocess planner: MPK contract is missing an MLA stage for pre route
    selection. Expected a plugin with processor='MLA' or kernel='infer'/'mla'
    in the MPK manifest.

which is the planner having found the manifest and not the pipeline. It happens
at step 6 of a run, on the board, a minute after the compile that caused it
finished on another machine entirely.

Every published pack carries all three files, so they are copied out of one
rather than composed here. ``0_preproc.json`` is the same bytes in every pack.
The other two are the same but for the ELF's name, the MLA output's size, and
one caps entry per model output -- three facts that are read back out of the
new pack's own manifest, so a detection pack gets six and a segmentation pack
gets ten without either number being written down.

Checked the only way it can be: rebuild the segmentation pack's two files from
the detection pack's, using nothing but the segmentation pack's own manifest,
and they come out identical to the ones it ships.
